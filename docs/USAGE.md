## üìå Notes

Ensure an internet connection for YouTube and Embedly API calls.
Calculators use local JavaScript (financial.js) and hardcoded South African rates (e.g., SARS transfer duties, GBS Prime at 10.75%). Update rates manually via data/rates.json.
For best performance, optimize images in the Gallery section (use WebP format).
Test responsiveness on mobile devices (320px‚Äì1200px) using browser dev tools.
