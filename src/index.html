            <!-- Budgeting & Planning -->
            <h3 class="group-title">Budgeting & Planning</h3>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Budgeting</h3>
                <p>Budgeting is the process of creating a plan to manage your income and expenses. For example, using a 50/30/20 rule, you allocate 50% of your income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings or debt repayment.</p>
                <p>Example: Budgeting for monthly groceries, transport, entertainment, and savings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Financial Plans</h3>
                <p>A financial plan combines your income, expenses, savings, and investments to achieve medium- and long-term financial goals. It helps you stay on track with your budget and prepares you for future events like education, retirement, or buying a home.</p>
                <p>Example: A family saving for university contributes R2,000 monthly to a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA), leveraging tax-free growth for 15 years.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Emergency Fund</h3>
                <p>An emergency fund is money set aside to cover unexpected expenses like medical bills, car repairs, or job loss. It usually covers 3–6 months of living costs.</p>
                <p>Example: Keeping R50,000 aside for medical emergencies or job loss.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Income & Expenses -->
            <h3 class="group-title">Income & Expenses</h3>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Saving</h3>
                <p>Saving involves setting aside money for future use, like an emergency fund or a big purchase. For instance, saving R500 monthly in a high-interest account can grow over time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Assets vs. Liabilities</h3>
                <p>Assets are things that generate income or appreciate in value, like property, stocks, or businesses.</p>
                <p>Liabilities are things that cost you money, like debt, loans, and expenses.</p>
                <p>Example: Owning a home (asset) that increases in value vs. paying off a car loan (liability) that reduces your financial position.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Income vs. Expenditure</h3>
                <p>Income is the money you earn, whether from a salary, business, or investments.</p>
                <p>Expenditure is the money you spend on living costs, such as food, rent, utilities, and debt repayments.</p>
                <p>Example: A monthly salary vs. monthly rent payments. Reducing unnecessary expenditure helps increase your savings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Cash Flow</h3>
                <p>The movement of money in and out of your account. Positive cash flow occurs when income exceeds expenses, while negative cash flow means you're spending more than you earn.</p>
                <p>Example: You earn R10,000 per month, but your total expenses are R8,000. You have R2,000 in positive cash flow to save or invest.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Investing -->
            <h3 class="group-title">Investing</h3>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Types of Investments</h3>
                <p>Different investments (stocks, bonds, real estate) offer varying returns and risk profiles.</p>
                <p>Example: Use EasyEquities to buy stocks and ETFs for growth, bond ETFs for stability, and consider real estate for income and value appreciation.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Diversification</h3>
                <p>Diversification means spreading investments across various asset classes to minimize risk. By diversifying, you can protect yourself from market fluctuations in one sector.</p>
                <p>Example: Rather than investing all your money in one stock, you could invest in a mix of stocks, bonds, real estate, and a retirement plan to balance risk.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Asset Allocation & Diversification</h3>
                <p>Asset allocation involves dividing your portfolio among different asset classes, while diversification spreads investments within those classes to reduce risk.</p>
                <p>Example: Create a diversified portfolio on EasyEquities by investing in local and international ETFs and stocks from different sectors.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Compound Interest</h3>
                <p>Compound interest is the interest on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods, accelerating growth over time.</p>
                <p>Example: R10,000 earning 8% annually grows to R14,693 after five years of compounding.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Markets & Products -->
            <h3 class="group-title">Markets & Products</h3>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>ETF (Exchange-Traded Fund)</h3>
                <p>An ETF is a collection of stocks or bonds that tracks an index and is traded on a stock exchange. It provides diversification and usually has low fees.</p>
                <p>Example: Investing in a SATRIX 40 ETF to gain exposure to the JSE's top-performing companies.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Unit Trust</h3>
                <p>A unit trust is a fund where many investors pool their money, which is then managed by professionals to invest in stocks, bonds, or property.</p>
                <p>Example: Saving R5,000 monthly in a balanced unit trust to fund future purchases.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>JSE (Johannesburg Stock Exchange)</h3>
                <p>The JSE is South Africa’s main stock market where shares of companies are bought and sold. It allows investors to buy ownership in businesses.</p>
                <p>Example: Buying MTN shares at R130 each through an online stockbroker.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>JSE Hours & Days</h3>
                <p>The JSE operates Monday to Friday, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, excluding South African public holidays.</p>
                <p>Example: Trading Sasol shares on a Tuesday afternoon during market hours.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Alternative Stocks</h3>
                <p>Alternative stocks refer to investments outside traditional sectors, such as renewable energy, commodities, or emerging tech companies.</p>
                <p>Example: Investing in a green energy firm listed on the JSE.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Property</h3>
                <p>Property investment involves buying real estate to earn rental income or benefit from long-term value increases.</p>
                <p>Example: Owning a R2 million apartment that generates R15,000 monthly in rental income.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Stocks</h3>
                <p>Stocks are shares of ownership in a company. Investors can earn money through price increases (capital gains) and dividends.</p>
                <p>Example: Investing in Woolworths shares for steady dividend payouts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Dividends</h3>
                <p>Dividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders from its profits. They provide regular income to investors.</p>
                <p>Example: Receiving R2,000 in annual dividends for holding 1,000 shares.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Bull Market</h3>
                <p>A bull market occurs when stock prices are rising over time, indicating strong investor confidence and economic growth.</p>
                <p>Example: The JSE Top 40 index gains 20% over six months due to strong corporate earnings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Bear Market</h3>
                <p>A bear market happens when stock prices drop 20% or more, often caused by economic slowdowns or negative investor sentiment.</p>
                <p>Example: The JSE falls sharply during a recession, leading to a bear market.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>S&P 500</h3>
                <p>The S&P 500 is a U.S. stock market index that tracks the 500 largest companies. It is used to measure the overall performance of the American stock market.</p>
                <p>Example: Investing in an ETF tracking the S&P 500 for international diversification.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Top 40</h3>
                <p>The Top 40 refers to the 40 largest companies listed on the JSE, by market value. It provides a snapshot of South Africa’s major businesses.</p>
                <p>Example: Investing in a Top 40 ETF for exposure to leading South African firms.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Trust Fund</h3>
                <p>A trust fund is a legal structure that holds money or assets on behalf of someone, usually for long-term care or inheritance purposes.</p>
                <p>Example: Parents setting up a trust fund for their children’s education.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Middle Class</h3>
                <p>The middle class includes people or families who earn enough to afford basic needs and some extra comforts. They usually have steady jobs and savings.</p>
                <p>Example: A family earning R20,000 monthly, affording housing, schooling, and leisure activities.</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Debt & Credit -->
            <h3 class="group-title">Debt & Credit</h3>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Credit Score</h3>
                <p>Your credit score is a number that represents how reliable you are at repaying borrowed money. Lenders use it to decide whether to approve your loan or credit application.</p>
                <p>Example: A score above 650 increases the likelihood of securing a home loan with better terms.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Credit Card</h3>
                <p>A credit card allows you to borrow money up to a certain limit to make purchases. If you pay off the balance each month, you avoid interest and build a good credit history.</p>
                <p>Example: Spending R5,000 monthly on a credit card and paying it off to avoid 18% annual interest charges.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Balloon Payment</h3>
                <p>A balloon payment is a large, final payment due at the end of a loan term. It allows for smaller monthly payments during the loan period, but requires paying a big amount at the end.</p>
                <p>Example: Paying R90,000 as a balloon payment for a R300,000 car after five years of financing.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Qualify vs. Afford</h3>
                <p>Qualifying means a lender agrees to lend you a certain amount based on your credit profile. Affording means whether the loan repayments comfortably fit within your monthly budget.</p>
                <p>Example: Qualifying for a R1 million loan but only affording repayments on R700,000 due to personal expenses.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Buying First Home</h3>
                <p>Buying your first home involves saving for a deposit, getting a home loan (bond), and understanding additional costs like transfer duties and legal fees.</p>
                <p>Example: Buying a R1 million home with a 10% deposit (R100,000) and covering R25,000 in bond registration fees.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Buying First Car</h3>
                <p>Buying your first car means choosing between new or used vehicles, saving for a deposit, and deciding whether to pay cash or use vehicle financing.</p>
                <p>Example: Buying a R150,000 used car with a 10% deposit (R15,000) and financing over three years.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Financing</h3>
                <p>Financing means borrowing money to buy something now and paying it back over time with interest. It’s common for large purchases like cars or homes.</p>
                <p>Example: Financing a car with a R200,000 loan at 11% interest for five years.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="definition-item">
                <h3>Interest Rate</h3>
                <p>The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money or the return earned on savings. It's shown as a percentage and can significantly affect loan repayments or investment returns.</p>
                <p>Example: Borrowing R100,000 at a 10% interest rate costs R10,000 annually in interest.</p>

                <h3>Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)</h3>
                <p>A TFSA is a savings or investment account where any interest, dividends, or capital gains earned are completely tax-free. There are annual and lifetime contribution limits, making it ideal for long-term growth.</p>
                <p>Example: Investing in a TFSA linked to the JSE Top 40 index, earning tax-free capital gains over a decade.</p>

                <p>Example: Saving 15% of your income in an RA that grows at 8% annually to amass R2.5 million by age 65.</p>
